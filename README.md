# Capstone-Project

Note for reviewer: I do not include my google-services.json file as it contains API keys.

The app itself looks relatively simple, however, there was a lot of back end work:
- using a third-party web library for charting (I had to build custom modules on JavaScript to load the data for the chart)
- Python scripts for generating charts in real time, uploading them on the web, creating records in firebase database, and generating notifications.
